*Easy-to-Use GUI
*Song list
*Play/Pause button
*Volume Slider

Controls are displayed on the screen but i will list them here as well
Mouse1 - Interact with buttons
Mouse1 (Hold & Move) - Scroll song list & use volume slider
Mouse1 (Double Tap) - Select artits/song

you can add songs to the included library nakilibs/musicplayer4/tracklist.txt with the following format
"table.insert(tracks, {"URL", "NAME"})"

!!NEW!! for the client side library (data/sf_filedata/musicplayer4/mytracklist.txt) you can add songs with the following format
"URL"||"ARTIST - NAME"

!!NEW but also new!! client side library addition, playing mp3s directly, use the following format in mytracklist.txt (FILE: is very important to be left like that, it's what my sound play function checks for when you try to play a song, SO KEEP IT IN)
"FILE:sounds/PATH HERE.mp3"||"ARTIST - NAME"
