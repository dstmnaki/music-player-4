Here's my music player project for starfall, garry's mod

you can add songs to the included library nakilibs/musicplayer4/tracklist.txt with the following format
"table.insert(tracks, {"URL", "NAME"})"

Controls are displayed on the screen but i will list them here as well
Mouse1/E - Interact with most buttons
Mouse1 - Scroll in song list
E - Select song in song list

Left top box toggles the song list, slider adjusts volume

Commands (untested on current release)
!play <id/url> <number/string>
!volume <number> (0-100)
